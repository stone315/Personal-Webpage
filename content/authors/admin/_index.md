I am Chak Lam Shek, currently a 3rd-year Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) since Fall 2021. Under the guidance of Professor [Pratap Tokekar](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/tokekar), my research primarily revolves around the design of planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. I have a particular interest in solving multiple-agent reinforcement learning problems. My work delves into creating frameworks to enhance agent coordination and improving exploration strategies for efficiency. Additionally, I have a keen interest in integrating Large Language Models (LLM) into the reinforcement learning process to adapt to various environmental challenges.

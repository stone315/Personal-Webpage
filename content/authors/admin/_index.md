I am Chak Lam Shek, currently a fifth-year Electrical Engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMD) since Fall 2021. Under the guidance of Professor [Pratap Tokekar](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/tokekar), my research primarily revolves around the design of planning and reinforcement learning algorithms. I have a particular interest in solving multiple-agent reinforcement learning problems. My work delves into creating frameworks to enhance agent coordination and improving exploration strategies for efficiency. 
Additionally, I have a keen interest in integrating Large Language Models (LLM) and World Model into the reinforcement learning process to adapt to various environmental challenges. Recently, my work has extended to applying Diffusion Models for autonomous vehicles and robotic systems, aiming to improve both planning and state estimation capabilities.
My research has been published in top robotics and machine learning conferences and journals, including ACC, IROS, RA-L, and MRS. Outside of research, I have also demonstrated strong data analysis and problem-solving skills, earning first place in the Schofield Datathon in 2015.

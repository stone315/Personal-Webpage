abstract: "In this work, the local problems are modeled as sub gradient problems that can be solved simultaneously by corresponding agents. The optimality of the sub gradient solutions with respect to global objective are made sure through information sharing between the agents during each iteration. The detailed modeling and implementation of the proposed method along with numerical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness are presented in the paper."

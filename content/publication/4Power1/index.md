abstract: "The number of Electric Vehicles in usage has been increasing and this trend creates a lot of challenges to the existing power grid. The advancements in the communication and control infrastructure have made applications such as real time charge 
scheduling of the Electric Vehicles possible. The main issue in case of Electric Vehicle charge scheduling is the scalability and the uncertainty concerning the customer charging patterns. In this work, a decentralized node level clustering technique based on customers 
charging pattern has been developed. An Integer Linear programming scheme is used to schedule the Electric Vehicles in each group separately. The detailed study of the effectiveness of the method developed is also presented in the paper. "
